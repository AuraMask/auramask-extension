## Support

If you're a user seeking support, [here is our support site](https://metamask.helpscoutdocs.com/).

## Developing Compatible Dapps

If you're a web dapp developer, we've got two types of guides for you:

### New Dapp Developers

- We recommend this [Learning Solidity](https://karl.tech/learning-solidity-part-1-deploy-a-contract/) tutorial series by Karl Floersch.
- We wrote a (slightly outdated now) gentle introduction on [Developing Dapps with Truffle and MetaMask](https://medium.com/metamask/developing-ethereum-dapps-with-truffle-and-metamask-aa8ad7e363ba).

### Current Dapp Developers

- If you have a Dapp, and you want to ensure compatibility, [here is our guide on building MetaMask-compatible Dapps](https://github.com/MetaMask/faq/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md)

## Building locally

 - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 6.3.1 or later.
 - Install local dependencies with `npm install`.
 - Install gulp globally with `npm install -g gulp-cli`.
 - Build the project to the `./dist/` folder with `gulp build`.
 - Optionally, to rebuild on file changes, run `gulp dev`.
 - To package .zip files for distribution, run `gulp zip`, or run the full build & zip with `gulp dist`.

 Uncompressed builds can be found in `/dist`, compressed builds can be found in `/builds` once they're built.

### Running Tests

Requires `mocha` installed. Run `npm install -g mocha`.

Then just run `npm test`.

You can also test with a continuously watching process, via `npm run watch`.

You can run the linter by itself with `gulp lint`.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Build for Publishing

```bash
npm run dist
```

#### Writing Browser Tests

To write tests that will be run in the browser using QUnit, add your test files to `test/integration/lib`.
