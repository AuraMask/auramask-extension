Dear IrMeta Users,

There have been several instances of high-profile legitimate websites such as BTC Manager and Games Workshop that have had their websites temporarily compromised. This involves showing a fake IrMeta window on the page asking for user's seed phrases. IrMeta will never open itself in this way and users are encouraged to report these instances immediately to either [our phishing blacklist](https://github.com/IrMeta/eth-phishing-detect/issues) or our support email at [support@irmeta.io](mailto:support@irmeta.io).

Please read our full article on this ongoing issue at [https://medium.com/irmeta/new-phishing-strategy-becoming-common-1b1123837168](https://medium.com/irmeta/new-phishing-strategy-becoming-common-1b1123837168).
